# Tools Meister

#### This is an app developed using Ruby on Rails during the Le Wagon Bootcamp. You can visit it [here](https://tools-meister.herokuapp.com/)

Team: [Lucas Petti](https://github.com/lucaspetti), [Ole Dening](https://github.com/OD91), [Karl Glatzel](https://github.com/Kalla226) and [Cedric Delahaye](https://github.com/CedDlh)

The goal of this app was to make a simple AirBnB clone. In this case, the user can search for different tools by city and category and rent them for a certain period.
